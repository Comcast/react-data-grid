#### Migration from 2.X to 3.X

### Differences
### 2.0.0
 - ~~Bundles `create-react-class` package with `react-data-grid`; ~~ ReactDataGrid is not longer dependent on `create-react-class` as all the components have been migrated to ES6 Classes ([#1078](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid/pull/1078) and [#1094](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid/pull/1094))

### 3.0.0
 - ~~Does not bundle `create-react-class` package with `react-data-grid`. It is specified as a peer dependency now [1065](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid/pull/1065); ~~ peer dependency is no longer required.

### Steps for a sucessfull migration
 - ~~Install create-react-class package (```npm install create-react-class```)~~ This is no longer required
